# 🍎 Fruit Cart System

A simple console-based C program where users can select fruits, add them to a cart, and view the total bill.

## 💡 Features
 Shows available fruits with prices  
 Lets you add items and quantities to your cart

The cart displays all selected items along with the total bill amount.

##🧠 Data Structures Used:
Singly Linked Lists

One linked list stores selected fruit identifiers.

Another linked list stores the calculated prices.

Structures (struct) are used to define linked list nodes.

Dynamic memory allocation is handled using malloc().
